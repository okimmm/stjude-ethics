    <h1 id="title">Schwartz’s Concept of UniversalValues</h1>
    
    <h2>This explores the concept of universal values, defining them as qualities that distinguish people,
things, events, or situations. It highlights the challenge of defining universal values due to their
connection to morality and ethics, which vary across individuals and cultures. To address this
challenge, this introduces Schwartz's research on universal values, which defines values as "conceptions of the desirable" that influence decision-making and evaluations. Schwartz's
research aims to uncover whether universal values exist and, if so, what they are.</h2>
